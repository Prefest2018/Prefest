This odd space-age utopian building was in much worse shape until a £20M renovation in 2006, with The Guardian characterizing it as one of the “most miserable places in London”: https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/artanddes...In that article, the architect mentions he originally wanted it built out of brick in the style of Alvar Aalto, but they had to settle for painted concrete. In 1970 even the paint job was cut from the budget and wasn’t done until the renovation, so for 36 years the Brunswick was a brutalist bunker.Im glad they fixed it.

This odd space-age utopian building was in much worse shape until a £20M renovation in 2006, with The Guardian characterizing it as one of the “most miserable places in London”: https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/artanddes...In that article, the architect mentions he originally wanted it built out of brick in the style of Alvar Aalto, but they had to settle for painted concrete. In 1970 even the paint job was cut from the budget and wasn’t done until the renovation, so for 36 years the Brunswick was a brutalist bunker.Im glad they fixed it. It’s an interesting landmark of British modernism’s fling with low-key sci-fi architecture — and the grocery store is good, I go there all the time."
